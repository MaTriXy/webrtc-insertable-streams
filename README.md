# WebRTC Encoded Transform

This repository contains a **proposal** for an API that allows the
insertion of user-defined processing steps in the pipeline that
handles encoded media in a WebRTC context.

In order to allow such processing, it defines a number of extensions
to the objects defined in [WEBRTC-PC](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/).

The editors' work-in-progress version of the document is at https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/
