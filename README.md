# WebRTC Encoded Media

This repository contains a **proposal** for an API that allows the
insertion of user-defined processing steps in the pipeline that
handles media in a WebRTC context.

In order to allow such processing, it defines a number of extensions
to the objects defined in [WEBRTC-PC](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/) and [MEDIACAPTURE-MAIN](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/), and also
draws upon definitions from [WEBRTC-CODEC](https://github.com/WICG/web-codecs).
